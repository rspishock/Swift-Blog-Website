He really enjoyed the characters Piper and Sloane and the friendship and understanding that develops between them as they learn to walk in each other's shoes. There's action, some humor and a special cameo kids will love at the end.“</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://swiftblogwebsite.com/posts/house</guid><title>Ninth House</title><description>A review of Ninth House.</description><link>https://swiftblogwebsite.com/posts/house</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2020 11:20:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Ninth House</h1><p>“ This exciting new fantasy novel begins with a slow burn as we are introduced to the secret societies of Yale. The titular ninth house, Lethe, is responsible for monitoring the other houses and keeping them in line. However, when the head of Lethe disappears unexpectedly, his freshman protege Galaxy "Alex" Stern, must fill in his position. Alex is certainly unorthodox with her "from the streets/take no BS" attitude and she tends to rub most of her fellow students and faculty the wrong way. But she'll need her grit and her special gift (the reason she's at Yale in the first place - no spoilers) in order to help solve the murder of a "townie" that may be related to the houses activity. There is much more to this story but I don't want to give anything away. Before long I was racing my way to the end. Bardugo does a great job of world building and character invention with room for more discoveries in future installments. <em>fingers crossed</em> A perfect fit for urban fantasy readers and fans of Kim Harrison.”</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://swiftblogwebsite.com/posts/last-book</guid><title>The Last Book on the Left</title><description>A review of The Last Book on the Left.</description><link>https://swiftblogwebsite.com/posts/last-book</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2020 11:20:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>The Last Book on the Left</h1><p>“ The hilarious and morbid LPOTL is one of my favorite podcasts. After reading Stay Sexy &amp; Don't Get Murdered: The Definitive How-To Guide (from another of my favorite podcasts) I was eager to read this offering from the guys. Long time listeners and hardcore true crime fans aren't going to learn anything new here. However, the humor and tone of the show are spot on which makes it very easy to "hear" Ben, Marcus &amp; Henry's voices as you read. That, combined with the new and hilarious illustrations, will make this a perfect keepsake for fans of the show!”</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
