# Anit/Hero

“ This "Freaky Friday" take on the superhero genre was a hit with my 7 year old son. He really enjoyed the characters Piper and Sloane and the friendship and understanding that develops between them as they learn to walk in each other's shoes.  There's action, some humor and a special cameo kids will love at the end.“
