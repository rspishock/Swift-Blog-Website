# Ninth House

“ This exciting new fantasy novel begins with a slow burn as we are introduced to the secret societies of Yale.  The titular ninth house, Lethe, is responsible for monitoring the other houses and keeping them in line.  However, when the head of Lethe disappears unexpectedly, his freshman protege Galaxy "Alex" Stern, must fill in his position.  Alex is certainly unorthodox with her "from the streets/take no BS" attitude and she tends to rub most of her fellow students and faculty the wrong way.  But she'll need her grit and her special gift (the reason she's at Yale in the first place - no spoilers) in order to help solve the murder of a "townie" that may be related to the houses activity.
There is much more to this story but I don't want to give anything away.  Before long I was racing my way to the end. Bardugo does a great job of world building and character invention with room for more discoveries in future installments. *fingers crossed* A perfect fit for urban fantasy readers and fans of Kim Harrison.”
