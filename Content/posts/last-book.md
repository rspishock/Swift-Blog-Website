# The Last Book on the Left

“ The hilarious and morbid LPOTL is one of my favorite podcasts.  After reading Stay Sexy & Don't Get Murdered: The Definitive How-To Guide (from another of my favorite podcasts) I was eager to read this offering from the guys.  Long time listeners and hardcore true crime fans aren't going to learn anything new here.  However, the humor and tone of the show are spot on which makes it very easy to "hear" Ben, Marcus & Henry's voices as you read. That, combined with the new and hilarious illustrations, will make this a perfect keepsake for fans of the show!”
